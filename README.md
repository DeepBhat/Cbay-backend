# C-BAY

## Setting up the project
Go to the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) for more information

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/DeepBhat/Cbay-backend` into the folder you wish to place your code.
2. Set up a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
3. After activating the virtual environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install Django and other modules needed.

Note: You should periodically update `requirements.txt` file, using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This helps other collaborators to download the modules you used.
4. Create a file `secret_key.txt` and copy-paste the secret key posted on discord. Make sure the `secret_key.txt` is in the same directory as `manage.py`.
